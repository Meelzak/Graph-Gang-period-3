Testing results - first round, on 16-1-2019, 17-1-2019
Ran them for about 1 minute now, finished: 11/20 graphs - will run the remaining 9 ones for 10 minutes later
Ran it with the normal settings we have in the testing program now.
Will look up the specs of my computer later, but itâ€™s a MacBook at least
