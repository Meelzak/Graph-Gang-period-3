What we want to test:
- difference between the three lower bound algorithms
- difference between the upper bound algorithms
- with and without cleaner and divider
- what the influence of sorting is on the algorithms
- different ordering of vertices, how this affects the algorithms
- difference that nr of vertices & edges make
- density of graphs
- special structure algorithms vs no special structure algorithms
----- more if you think of new ones -----

Rules for testing:
- if you use cleaner and divider / cleaner, you can't use the algorithms anymore, but you can use the upper and lower bound stuff
- ALWAYS write down if you use the cleaner and divider AND what kind of computer you use
- do not run multiple graphs at the same time
- run it for a fixed amount of time -> 10 minutes, then kill it

Need to research
-regular graphs
-planar graphs
